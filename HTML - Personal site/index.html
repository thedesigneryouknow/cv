        <p>
          I am a self-taught Web-Developer, your go-to person for Photoshop, and a Graphic Designer. Starting the self taught
          journey had been a very very long path for me. To just learn web-development it took me almost 2 years due to lack of perseverance
          and a habit of procrastination. Finally, I made up my mind in March of 2022 and started my journey in this field with Photoshop
          as I found it a bit creative and engaging and thought doing this would help me in keeping my learnings on track without any distraction.
          And after that in just 2 months of consisteny I am able to build things which I have ever thought of.
